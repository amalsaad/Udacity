You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:

 
* What new skills have you learned?
 
From the first leason I have learned new syntax in HTML, problem solving, using the correct syntax.  
* What has been difficult?

 * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
